<h1>NVDA Add-on Scons Template</h1>
<p>This package contains a basic template structure for NVDA add-on development, building, distribution and localization.
For details about NVDA add-on development, please see the <a href="https://github.com/nvdaaddons/DevGuide/wiki/NVDA-Add-on-Development-Guide">NVDA Add-on Development Guide</a>.
The NVDA add-on development/discussion list <a href="https://nvda-addons.groups.io/g/nvda-addons">is here</a>
Information specific to NV Access add-on store <a href="https://github.com/nvaccess/addon-datastore">can be found here</a>.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>This template provides the following features you can use during NVDA add-on development and packaging:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic add-on package creation, with naming and version loaded from a centralized build variables file (buildVars.py) or command-line interface.<ul>
<li>See packaging section for details on using command-line switches when packaging add-ons with custom version information.</li>
<li>This process will happen automatically when receiving a pull request, and there is also the possibility of manual launch.</li>
<li>To let the workflow run automatically when pushing to main or master (development) branch, remove the comment for branches line in GitHub Actions (<code>.github/workflows/build_addon.yml</code>).</li>
<li>If you have created a tag (E.G.: <code>git tag v1.0 &amp;&amp; git push --tag</code>), then a release will be automatically created and the add-on file will be uploaded as an asset.</li>
<li>Otherwise, with normal commits or with manual startup, you can download the artifacts from the Actions page of your repository.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Manifest file creation using a template (manifest.ini.tpl). Build variables are replaced on this template. See below for add-on manifest specification.</li>
<li>Compilation of gettext mo files before distribution, when needed.<ul>
<li>To generate a gettext pot file, please run <code>scons pot</code>. An <code>addon-name.pot</code> file will be created with all gettext messages for your add-on. You need to check the <code>buildVars.i18nSources</code> variable to comply with your requirements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Automatic generation of manifest localization files directly from gettext po files. Please make sure buildVars.py is included in i18nFiles.</li>
<li>Automatic generation of HTML documents from markdown (.md) files, to manage documentation in different languages.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, this template includes configuration files for the following tools for use in add-on development and testing (see "additional tools" section for details):</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruff (pyproject.toml/tool.ruff sections): a Python linter written in Rust. Sections starting with tool.ruff house configuration options for Ruff.</li>
<li>Configuration for VS Code. It requires NVDA's repo at the same level as the add-on folder containing your actual source files, with prepared source code (<code>scons source</code>). preparing the source code is a step in the instructions for building NVDA itself, see <a href="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda">The NVDA Repository</a> for details.<ul>
<li>Place the .vscode in this repo within the addon folder, where your add-on source files (will) reside. The settings file within this folder assumes the NVDA repository is within the parent folder of this folder. If your addon folder is within the addonTemplate folder, then your NVDA repository folder needs to also be within the addonTemplate folder, or the source will not be found.</li>
<li>Open the addon folder in VS Code. This should initialize VS Code with the correct settings and provide you with code completion and other VS Code features. </li>
<li>Press <code>control+shift+m</code> after saving a file to search for problems.</li>
<li>Use arrow and tab keys for the autocompletion feature.</li>
<li>Press <code>control+shift+p</code> to open the commands palette and search for recommended extensions to install or check if they are installed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pyright (pyproject.toml/tool.pyright sections): a Python static type checker. Sections starting with tool.pyright house configuration options for Pyright.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>You need the following software to use this code for your NVDA add-on development and packaging:</p>
<ul>
<li>a Python distribution (3.13 64-bit or later is recommended). Check the <a href="https://www.python.org">Python Website</a> for Windows Installers.</li>
<li>Scons - <a href="https://www.scons.org/">Website</a> - version 4.10.1 or later. You can install it via PIP.</li>
<li>GNU Gettext tools, if you want to have localization support for your add-on - Recommended. Any Linux distro or cygwin have those installed. You can find windows builds <a href="https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/gettext.php">here</a>.</li>
<li>Markdown 3.8.2 or later, if you want to convert documentation files to HTML documents. You can install it via PIP.</li>
<li>Optional: additional tools such as linters and type checkers defined in pyproject.toml file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: you may not need these tools in a local build environment; you can use <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions">GitHub Actions</a> to build and package your add-ons.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>To create a new NVDA add-on using this template:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create an empty folder to hold the files for your add-on.</li>
<li>Copy the folder:
<code>site_scons</code>
and the following files, into your new empty folder:
<code>buildVars.py
manifest.ini.tpl
manifest-translated.ini.tpl
sconstruct
.gitignore
.gitattributes</code></li>
<li>If you intend to use the provided GitHub workflow, also copy the folder:
<code>.github</code>
and file:
<code>.pre-commit-config.yaml</code></li>
<li>Create an <code>addon</code> folder inside your new folder. You will put your code in the usual folders for NVDA extensions, under the <code>addon</code> folder. For instance: <code>globalPlugins</code>, <code>synthDrivers</code>, etc.</li>
<li>In the <code>buildVars.py</code> file, change variable <code>addon_info</code> with your add-on's information (name, summary, description, version, author, url, source url, license, and license URL). Also, be sure to carefully set the paths contained in the other variables in that file. If you need to use custom Markdown extensions, original add-on interface language is not English, or include custom braille translations tables, be sure to fil out markdown list, base language variable, and braille tables dictioanry, respectively.</li>
<li>Gettext translations must be placed into <code>addon\locale\&lt;lang&gt;/LC_MESSAGES\nvda.po</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Add-on manifest specification</h4>
<p>An add-on manifest generated manually or via <code>buildVars.py</code> must include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name (string): a unique internal identifier for the add-on. It must use camel case (e.g. someModule). This is also used as part of add-on store to identify the add-on uniquely.</li>
<li>Summary (string): name as shown on NVDA's Add-on store.</li>
<li>Description (string): a short detailed description about the add-on.</li>
<li>Version (string), ideally number.number with an optional third number, denoting major.minor.patch.</li>

</ol>
<h3>To package the add-on for distribution:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Open a command line, change to the folder that has the <code>sconstruct</code> file (usually the root of your add-on development folder) and run the <code>scons</code> command. The created add-on, if there were no errors, is placed in the current directory.</li>
<li>You can further customize variables in the <code>buildVars.py</code> file.</li>
<li>You can also customize version and update channel information from command line by passing the following switches when running scons:<ul>
<li>version: add-on version string of the form major.minor or major.minor.patch (all integers)</li>
<li>channel: update channel (do not use this switch unless you know what you are doing).</li>
